description: 'Publish a self-hosted MCP on Smithery to gain distribution and observability while keeping your own hosting.'
---
You can publish an MCP to Smithery that is hosted on your own infrastructure.

### Why publish a self-hosted MCP?

- **Distribution**: Make your MCP discoverable and installable via Smithery.
- **Observability**: Smithery surfaces logs so you can understand how your users are using your MCP.

### Requirements

- **Public HTTPS URL** for your MCP over Streamable HTTP
- If your server requires user authorization, it should **follow the OAuth spec** your MCP advertises so users can authenticate when prompted.

### Publish an external MCP on Smithery

1. In Smithery, create a New Server.
2. Choose to publish an External MCP.
3. In the deployments page, click Deploy and enter your server’s HTTPS URL.
4. Create the server to finish publishing.

Your server will appear on Smithery and can be installed like any other HTTP MCP.

### Server Scanning

Smithery performs a scan of your server to extract metadata (for example, tools and prompts) used to render your server page.

- If your server is reachable and does not require authorization, the scan completes automatically and your page is populated shortly.
- If your server requires authorization or additional configuration, we’ll prompt you in the UI to authenticate. This configures a test profile and Smithery will automatically retry the scan. Once the connection succeeds, your server page will update with accurate tool information. See the in-product fix dialog when a scan requires attention.

You can revisit your server page to see the current scan status and logs.
