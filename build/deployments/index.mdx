---

Smithery Deployments allow you to distribute your MCP server to users of Smithery, hosted and served over [Streamable HTTP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/transports#streamable-http) connection. This lets users easily access your server seamlessly from any MCP client, eliminating the need for them to install dependencies or worry about security.

> If you're self-hosting and only need listing and distribution on Smithery, you can publish an external MCP by URL. See [External MCPs](/build/external).

## Choose Your Deployment Method

- **[Using Smithery CLI](/build/deployments/typescript)** (Recommended) - For servers using the official MCP TypeScript SDK. Use `npm create smithery` to create a scaffold if you're starting from scratch
- **[Using Docker Container](/build/deployments/custom-container)** (Advanced) - Need custom environment or using another language? Get full Docker control

**Have an STDIO server that runs locally?**

- Check our [migration guides](/migrations/stdio-to-http) to convert it for Smithery deployment
