The fastest way to deploy TypeScript MCP servers on Smithery. This method automatically builds and deploys your server using our TypeScript runtime.

## Prerequisites

- TypeScript MCP server
- Built with the [Smithery CLI](https://github.com/smithery-ai/cli)
- Repository with `package.json` and proper entry points

## Setup

Create a `smithery.yaml` file in your repository root:

```yaml
runtime: "typescript"
```

See the [Getting Started guide](/getting_started/quickstart_build) for complete TypeScript server development instructions.

## Deploy

1. Push your code (including `smithery.yaml`) to GitHub
2. [Connect your GitHub](https://smithery.ai/new) to Smithery (or claim your server if already listed)
3. Navigate to the Deployments tab on your server page
4. Click Deploy to build and host your server

## Configuration

For servers that require configuration (API keys, settings, etc.), export a `configSchema` in your TypeScript code:

```typescript
import { z } from "zod";

export const configSchema = z.object({
  apiKey: z.string().describe("Your API key"),
  timeout: z.number().default(5000).describe("Request timeout in milliseconds"),
});
```

This schema will automatically generate configuration forms for users connecting to your server.

## Build Process

When you deploy, Smithery will:

1. Clone your repository
2. Install dependencies with `npm ci`
3. Build your TypeScript code with `npm run build`
4. Package and deploy your server
5. Make it available at `https://server.smithery.ai/your-server/mcp`

## Troubleshooting

### Build Failures

If your build fails, check:
- Your `package.json` has a `build` script
- All dependencies are listed in `dependencies` or `devDependencies`
- Your TypeScript compiles without errors locally

### Runtime Issues

- Ensure your server exports a default function that returns an MCP server instance
- Check that your configuration schema matches what users are providing
- Review the deployment logs in your server's dashboard
