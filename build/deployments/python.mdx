## Overview

Deploy Python MCP servers using FastMCP with automatic containerization and infrastructure managed by Smithery.

## Prerequisites

- Python MCP server using FastMCP (1.0 or 2.0 supported) that exports a server creation function
- Python 3.12+ installed locally
- A Python package manager: [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (recommended), poetry, or pip

<Note>
**New to MCP servers?** See the [Getting Started guide](/getting_started/quickstart_build) to learn how to build Python MCP servers from scratch using FastMCP.
</Note>

## Project Structure

Your Python project should look like this:

```
my-mcp-server/
  smithery.yaml          # Smithery configuration
  pyproject.toml         # Python dependencies and configuration
  src/
    my_server/
      __init__.py
      server.py          # Your MCP server code with decorated function
```

## Setup

### 1. Configure smithery.yaml

Create a `smithery.yaml` file in your repository root (usually where the `pyproject.toml` is):

```yaml
runtime: "python"
```

That's it! This minimal configuration is intentional - Smithery handles containerization, and deployment automatically for Python projects.

### 2. Configure pyproject.toml

Your `pyproject.toml` must include the Smithery server configuration:

```toml
[build-system]
requires = ["uv_build>=0.8.15,<0.9.0"]
build-backend = "uv_build"

[project]
name = "my-mcp-server"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "My MCP server"
readme = "README.md"
requires-python = ">=3.12"
dependencies = [
    "mcp[cli] (>=1.13.0)",
    "smithery (>=0.1.22)",
]

[project.scripts]
dev = "smithery.cli.dev:main"
playground = "smithery.cli.playground:main"

# Points to your server function
[tool.smithery] # [!code highlight]
server = "my_server.server:create_server" # [!code highlight]
```

### 3. Ensure Proper Server Structure

Your Python MCP server must have a function decorated with `@smithery.server()` that returns a FastMCP server object.

```python
# src/my_server/server.py
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP
from smithery.decorators import smithery

@smithery.server() # [!code highlight]
def create_server():
    """Create and return a FastMCP server instance."""
    
    server = FastMCP(name="My Server")

    @server.tool()
    def my_tool(text: str) -> str:
        """Example tool that processes text."""
        return f"Processed: {text}"

    return server
```

**Key Requirements:**
- Function must be decorated with `@smithery.server()`
- Function must return a FastMCP server instance
- The function path must be specified in `[tool.smithery]` section of `pyproject.toml`

## Local Development

After installing dependencies (`uv sync` or `poetry install`), test your server locally using the Smithery CLI:

```bash
# Start development server with interactive playground
uv run playground
# or
poetry run playground

# Or just run the server
uv run dev
# or  
poetry run dev
```

This opens the **Smithery interactive playground** where you can:
- Test your MCP server tools in real-time
- See tool responses and debug issues
- Experiment with different inputs

## Deploy

1. Push your code (including `smithery.yaml`) to GitHub
2. [Connect your GitHub](https://smithery.ai/new) to Smithery (or claim your server if already listed)
3. Navigate to the Deployments tab on your server page
4. Click Deploy to build and host your server

## Good to Know

<Accordion title="What happens under the hood?">
When you deploy, Smithery will:

1. Clone your repository
2. Parse your `smithery.yaml` to detect Python runtime
3. Install dependencies using uv
4. Load your server function specified in `[tool.smithery]` configuration
5. Package your server into a containerized HTTP service
6. Deploy the container to our hosting infrastructure
7. Send MCP `initialize` and `list_tools` messages to discover your server's capabilities
8. Make it available at `https://server.smithery.ai/your-server/mcp`
9. Handle load balancing, scaling, and monitoring
</Accordion>


## Troubleshooting

<Accordion title="Why does my deployment fail?">
Common deployment failures and solutions:

- **Missing server configuration**: Ensure your `pyproject.toml` has the `[tool.smithery]` section with correct server path
- **Dependencies not found**: All dependencies must be listed in the `dependencies` array
- **Import errors**: Verify your server module can be imported and the function exists
- **Server doesn't run locally**: Before deploying, verify your server works locally:
  ```bash
  uv run smithery dev
  # or uv run dev (if project script set up)
  ```
  If this fails, fix any Python errors or missing dependencies first
- **Missing smithery decorator**: Ensure your server function is decorated with `@smithery.server()`
