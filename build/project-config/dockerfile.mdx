Create a `Dockerfile` in your repository root that defines how to build your MCP server. Your Dockerfile should be created such that running your Docker image will start your Streamable HTTP server.

## Example Dockerfile

Here's an example Dockerfile that builds a Node-based MCP server:

```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine

WORKDIR /app

# Copy package files
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy application code
COPY . .

# Build the application
RUN npm run build

CMD ["node", "dist/index.js"]
```

## Requirements

**We only support Linux Docker images on major distros (Alpine/Debian-based) and expect `sh` to run in your container. Other distros are untested and may not deploy.**

## Examples

You can find examples of Dockerfiles in Smithery's [reference implementations](https://github.com/smithery-ai/mcp-servers).
