Once you've [built your MCP server](/getting_started/quickstart_build), you're ready to deploy it to Smithery! 

Smithery Deployments allow you to host your MCP server on Smithery served over [Streamable HTTP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/transports#streamable-http) connection. This gives your users access to a tool playground and eliminates the need for them to install dependencies or worry about security.

If you're self-hosting and only need listing and distribution on Smithery, you can publish an external MCP by URL. See [External MCPs](/build/external).

## Deployment Options

Choose the deployment method that best fits your needs:

- **[TypeScript Deployment](/build/deployments/typescript)** (Recommended) - Automatic builds with TypeScript runtime. Perfect for servers built with the Smithery CLI.
- **[Custom Container Deployment](/build/deployments/custom-container)** (Advanced) - Full Docker control for any language. Complete flexibility over your environment and dependencies.

| **Setup Complexity** | Simple | Advanced |
| **Build Time** | Fast | Varies |
| **Language Support** | TypeScript/JavaScript | Any language |
