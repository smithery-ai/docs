Smithery Deployments allow you to host your MCP server on Smithery served over [Streamable HTTP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/transports#streamable-http) connection.

If you're self-hosting and only need listing and distribution on Smithery, you can publish an external MCP by URL. See [External MCPs](/build/external).
