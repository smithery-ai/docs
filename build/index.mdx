Smithery supports developers building MCPs with [CI/CD deployments, hosting](/build/deployments), and observability tools. When you host on Smithery, you get:

- **Discovery & Testing** - A dedicated page with an interactive playground where users can discover and try your MCP server online
- **Zero Setup** - Users can connect from any MCP client without installing dependencies or security concerns
- **Better Visibility** - Hosted servers rank higher in our search results and registry

## Getting Started

Choose your development approach from our cookbooks:

- <Icon icon="rocket" size={16} /> **[Quick Start (Recommended)](/getting_started/quickstart_build)** - Uses the official MCP TypeScript SDK with Smithery CLI for building and interactively testing your server
- <Icon icon="container" size={16} /> **[Docker Container (Advanced)](/cookbooks/python_custom_container)** - Build MCP servers using Docker containers in any language.

> If you already host your MCP elsewhere and just want distribution and observability on Smithery, see [External MCPs (self-hosted)](/build/external).
