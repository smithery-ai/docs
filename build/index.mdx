Smithery supports developers building MCPs by providing [CI/CD deployments and hosting](/build/deployments).

**Benefits of hosting:**

- Smithery will show a tool playground on your server page, allowing users to discover and try your MCP online.
- Users can call your server without installing dependencies or be concerned about security.
- Smithery will rank hosted servers higher in our search results.
