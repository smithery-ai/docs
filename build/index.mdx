Smithery supports developers building MCPs by providing [CI/CD deployments and hosting](/build/deployments), plus observability tools to monitor usage.

**Benefits of hosting:**

- Smithery creates a dedicated page for your server with a playground, allowing users to discover and try your MCP online.
- Users can use your server with any client without installing dependencies or being concerned about security.
- Smithery will rank hosted servers higher in our search results.

## Getting Started

Choose your development approach:

- **[Quick Start (Recommended)](/getting_started/quickstart_build)** - Uses the official MCP TypeScript SDK with Smithery CLI for building and interactively testing your server
- **[Docker Container (Advanced)](/cookbooks/python_custom_container)** - Build MCP servers using Docker containers in any language for maximum flexibility

> If you already host your MCP elsewhere and just want distribution and observability on Smithery, see [External MCPs (self-hosted)](/build/external).
