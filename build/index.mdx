Smithery supports developers building MCPs by providing [CI/CD deployments and hosting](/build/deployments), plus observability tools to monitor usage and performance.

**Benefits of hosting:**

- Smithery will show a tool playground on your server page, allowing users to discover and try your MCP online.
- Users can call your server without installing dependencies or be concerned about security.
- Smithery will rank hosted servers higher in our search results.

## Getting Started

Choose your development approach:

- **[Quick Start (Recommended)](/getting_started/quickstart_build)** - Uses the official MCP TypeScript SDK with Smithery CLI for building and interactive testing with playground
- **[Custom Container (Advanced)](/build/custom-containers)** - Build MCP servers with any language using Docker containers for maximum flexibility

> If you already host your MCP elsewhere and just want distribution and observability on Smithery, see [External MCPs (self-hosted)](/build/external).
