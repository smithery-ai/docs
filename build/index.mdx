## Introduction

Smithery Deployments allow you to distribute your MCP server to users, hosted and served over [Streamable HTTP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/transports#streamable-http) connection. When you host on Smithery, you get:

- **Discovery** - A dedicated page with an interactive playground where users can discover and try your MCP server online
- **Zero Setup** - Users can connect from any MCP client without installing dependencies or security concerns
- **Better Visibility** - Hosted servers rank higher in our search results and registry

> If you're self-hosting and only need listing and distribution on Smithery, you can publish an external MCP by URL. See [External MCPs](/build/external).

## Deployment Patterns

Smithery supports two main deployment patterns to accommodate different development needs:

### Native CLI Support (Recommended)

We provide native support for the most popular MCP development frameworks through our CLI, handling containerization and deployment automatically:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card
    title="TypeScript with Smithery CLI"
    icon="braces"
    href="/build/deployments/typescript"
  >
    Integrates directly with the official MCP TypeScript SDK.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Python with Smithery CLI"
    icon="python"
    href="/build/deployments/python"
  >
    Works with the official MCP SDK's FastMCP (both v1 and v2).
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

This is the **recommended approach** for most developers as it requires minimal configuration and follows best practices out of the box.

### Custom Container (Advanced)

For advanced use cases or other languages:

<Card
  title="Custom Docker Container"
  icon="docker"
  href="/build/deployments/custom-container"
>
  Full control over your deployment environment. Requires additional setup to ensure compatibility with Smithery's hosting infrastructure.
</Card>

Choose this pattern when you need custom runtime environments, specific system dependencies, or are using languages other than TypeScript/Python.

**Have an existing STDIO server?** Check our [migration guides](/migrations/stdio-to-http) to convert it for Smithery deployment.
