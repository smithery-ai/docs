# Migrate STDIO to HTTP

Hosted STDIO transport will be sunset on **August 26, 2025**. Migrate to HTTP transport before this date to ensure uninterrupted service for your users.

## Why Migrate to HTTP?

HTTP transport offers significant improvements over STDIO:

- **20x Higher Concurrency**: Handle significantly more simultaneous requests
- **Lower Latency**: Direct HTTP communication for faster response times  
- **Better Resource Efficiency**: More efficient resource utilization
- **Future-Proofing**: HTTP is the recommended remote transport in MCP specifications
